In order to take advantage of additional tools for viewing the contents 
of the database, we used additional libraries 
developed by third parties and made available for free on the microstrategy website.
For convenience they have already been downloaded and placed in the folder "microstrategy_additional_libraries".
To import them just click on the "plus" button in the "collection" section on the right 
and directly select all the zip files contained in this folder.
The new views will now be inserted.
